# Best-First Search Pathfinding Simulation

This project is a Python-based visualization of the Best-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding. It demonstrates how heuristic-based decisions are used to find the most optimal route between two points in a grid.

Features

- Dynamic grid creation
- Obstacle placement
- Real-time visualization of the Best-First Search
- Start and end point selection
- Interactive simulation using Pygame

Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pygame — for graphical representation
- Priority Queue (heapq) — for managing the frontier nodes based on heuristic
